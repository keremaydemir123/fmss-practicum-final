# ***FMSS React Practicum Final Project***
This project was created as part of the FMSS React Practicum. The goal of this project is to use React, axios, and react-router to create an application that lists Star Wars starships and allows users to search and view details about each ship.

## ***Technologies Used***
The following technologies were used in this project:

- ***Vite*** - A build tool that provides a fast and efficient development experience.
- ***React*** - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- ***Typescript*** - A statically typed language that helps catch errors at compile time.
- ***Tailwind CSS*** - A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined classes to help quickly build custom styles.

## ***Getting Started***
To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```console
git clone https://github.com/keremaydemir123/fmss-practicum-final.git
cd fmss-practicum-final
npm install
```

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```console
npm run dev
```
Alternatively, you can check out the live version of the project [here](https://fmss-practicum-final.vercel.app/).

### Details Page

## ***Usage***
Once the application is running, users can view a list of Star Wars starships, including their name, model, and hyperdrive rating. Users can also search for starships by name or model using the search bar at the top of the page.

Clicking on any item in the list will take the user to a detail page that provides additional information about the selected starship, including the number of passengers, maximum atmosphering speed, manufacturer, crew, and cargo capacity.

From the detail page, users can easily navigate back to the home page using the back button.

## ***Conclusion***
This project demonstrates how to build a simple React application that interacts with an API and allows users to search and view data. By using modern technologies like Typescript and Tailwind CSS, we can create applications quickly and efficiently while still providing a great user experience.
